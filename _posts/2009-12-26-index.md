GCH's Gary Thornton set a new course record in the 8th Fields of Athenry 10km, in an exceptional time of 29:57. Donegal's and Finn Valley's Teresa McGloin took the ladies title ahead of last year's winner Catherine Conway, smashing the course record along the way too. 

It took 3 scheduled dates to get the race held, with the original race, and the first rescheduled race both cancelled due to ice and snow on the course.
