##‘Fields’ 10km Teams Up With Tidy Towns
Athenry AC, hosts of the nationally famous ‘Fields of Athenry 10km’ road race each Dec 26th, has this year announced a tie-in with the Athenry Tidy Towns Committee. A contribution from the proceeds from this year’s race will be made to support the work of the Tidy Town Committee.

Over the last few years, both groups have contributed significantly to the development of the Athenry. The athletics club has an active and growing membership of both adult and juvenile runners that travel the length and breadth of the country to participate in road races, track and field and cross-country events. 

For its part, the Athenry Tidy Town Committee has worked ceaselessly over the years to improve the local environment. Throughout the year, the committee’s volunteers can be seen all over town, with spades, brooms and paint brushes in hand, doing their good work.
