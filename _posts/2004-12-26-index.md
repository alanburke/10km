On St. Stephen's day last over 250 runners and walkers took to the roads around Athenry for the annual 'Fields of Athenry' 10K Road Race.  Little were they to know of the natural disaster that was unfolding on the other side of the world at the same time. 

The race in Athenry, which was blessed with beautiful weather conditions, went without a hitch.  The full extent of the devastation throughout Asia only became apparent to most Irish people in the following days. 

Due to the participation of runners and walkers from all over the west of Ireland, the race generated a surplus.  Therefore, the organising club, Athenry AC (Senior), has decided make a substantial donation to GOAL to assist in relief efforts from these proceeds. 

Race organiser James Lundon said, "Like everyone else we were completely taken aback by what happened on race day and this is just one small gesture towards the great work that GOAL do. Hopefully we'll be able to do more over the coming weeks and months."

Finally, the race organisers would like to thank their main sponsors, Proactive, as well as Peter Gilhooley and Athenry Credit Union for their kind support of the event.
