##Thornton and Conway take the spoils in Fields of Athenry 10km

Perfect running conditions led to to some fast times on the Fields of Athenry 10km race today.

Many recorded PBs, thanks to the weather, and the carb-loading of the previous days!

Gary Thornton of GCH continued his dominace of this event with a great performance to take the men's title, while Catherine Conway of Mayo just edged a previous winner, Lucy Brennan, to take the women's title.

From everyone at Athenry AC, thanks to everyone who took part, and to all our volunteers.
