Over the last number of years this has has become one of the leading road races in the country, and this year we aim to raise the bar higher. The race takes in a loop of the fields and finishes under the medival arch in Athenry. 

##Last entries taken \[if we have any left!\] at 5pm on 23rd December.

## Race numbers are available for collection from 9:30am in Presentation College Athenry Sports Hall.

###Reminder - No entries available on the day!

While there is a good amount of parking in the School grounds, there is more parking near the railway station for those travelling from the North.
As people exit off the new motorway, take the very first exit, don't go into the town centre, head across the railway line towards the Raheen Woods Hotel. Take the new road through the Raheen Industrial estate, and park at the railway station. This route will be marked with signs.

It would life easier for everybody if people could car-pool to take the pressure off parking.

No numbers are issued by post. Race packs will be available for collection from 9:30am on the morning on the race at our Race HQ in Presentation College Athenry. Your souvenir hat is also provided then, and copies of our race programme will also be available. Registration closes at 10:45am sharp.  

Your race pack contains your race number which should be worn on your front, safety pins provided, and MUST be visible at all times.
Also in the pack is your timing chip. This should be attached to one of your shoes using the ties provided. Please follow the instructions provided at registration. 

It's a new chip system - its a strip that must form a loop on top of your laces, and must not be folded. It's also disposable - we don't collect it at the finish line.

Tea, coffee and other refreshments are provided in the hall after the race from 11:30am, and we hope to have our prizegiving at 1pm.

In the hopefully unlikely event that inclement weather puts a spanner in the works, we will update our website as soon as possible.
