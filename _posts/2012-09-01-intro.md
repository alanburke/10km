On a day that will be remembered in Nursing Homes in 40 years time - as in "Do ya remember that fecking day in Athenry when it lashed beforehand and proceeded to get worse during da race?, do ya?" - runners from the West of Ireland and elsewhere proved what a gritty and occasionally cheery lot we are by surviving and in some cases thriving in the annual Fields of Athenry 10k 2012.

After a beautiful Christmas Day, dawn didn't so much announce its arrival as slither into existence with a barely discernable contast to the night. It didn't get better and the rain duly began at 10am, continuing through the race start an hour later, until at 11:40 or so...the Heavens opened. And remained opened.

Considering this and the several feet-high water hazards in the last 4k, some remarkable times were achieved. Men's winner, Mick Clohisey (Raheny Shamrocks), can feel proud of his 30:57, a time that would surely have been 30 seconds plus faster on a normal day. He was followed home by Emmett Dunleavy (Sligo) 31:36 and Michael Shannon (St. John's) 31:40.

Women's winner Elish (Raheny Shamrocks), 35:44, made it a double for the Dubs by winning the Senior Female race over Catherine Conway (Mayo) 36:08 and Eimear O'Leary, 38:16.
