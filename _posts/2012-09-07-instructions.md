## Race numbers are available for collection from 9:30am in Presentation College Athenry Sports Hall.

Reminder - No entries available on the day!

In the hopefully unlikely event that inclement weather puts a spanner in the works, we will update the website www.athenryac.com as soon as possible.
While there is a good amount of parking in the School grounds, there is more parking near the railway station for those travelling from the North.
As people exit off the new motorway, take the very first exit, don't go into the town centre, head across the railway line towards the Raheen Woods Hotel. Take the new road through the Raheen Industrial estate, and park at the railway station. This route will be marked with signs.

It would life easier for everybody if people could car-pool to take the pressure off parking.

No numbers are issued by post. Race packs will be available for collection from 9:30am on the morning on the race at our Race HQ in Presentation College Athenry. Your souvenir hat is also provided then, and copies of our race programme will also be available. Registration closes at 10:45am sharp.
Your race pack contains your race number which should be worn on your front, safety pins provided, and MUST be visible at all times.
Also in the pack is your timing chip. This should be attached to one of your shoes using the ties provided. Please follow the instructions provided at registration. The chip is collected at the finish line - Please don't leave the finish area without returning it.
Tea, coffee and other refreshments are provided in the hall downstairs after the race from 11:30am, and we hope to have our prizegiving at 1pm.
